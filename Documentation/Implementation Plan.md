# SCM Platform Implementation Plan

_This document outlines the detailed implementation strategy for the Smart Chaos Machines platform. For architectural decisions and project overview, see [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md). For team collaboration practices, see [Ways of Working](Ways-of-Working.md)._

## Work Methodology: Agile with Phased Focus

**Agile Framework:** 2-week sprints with clear phase boundaries

_Team collaboration approach detailed in [Ways of Working](Ways-of-Working.md) - includes pair programming practices, visual planning, and architecture-driven sprint planning._

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 sprints)

**Focus:** Prove the core mechanics work

- **Sprint 1:** `Stable Communication` (Subscribe to CMs, basic read/write) + `Deployment` (Containerization)
- **Sprint 2:** Complete `Testability` SPIKE + basic **Developer Observability** (health checks)

**Key Architecture Components:** _See [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md) for detailed architecture decisions_

- Communication Module foundation
- Basic containerization for Kubernetes deployment

### Phase 2: Core Value Loop (4 sprints)

**Focus:** Deliver the MVP control loop

- **Sprint 3-4:** `Data Management` (validation, recording user changes, cloud streaming setup) + `Settings Management` (listen to events, apply configurations)
- **Sprint 5:** Complete `Settings Management` (retry logic, validation) + **User Observability** (local dashboards)
- **Sprint 6:** **Developer Observability** (distributed tracing, APM) + cloud data lake integration + prepare for UAT

**Critical Integrations:**

- Cloud data lake streaming pipeline setup
- OPC-UA integration with counting machines
- Recipe API and Line Configuration integration

### Phase 3: Stabilization & Testing (3 sprints)

- **Sprint 7:** End-to-end testing with CM simulator, bug fixes, performance optimization
- **Sprint 8:** Deploy to a UAT line in the factory + validate cloud data streaming
- **Sprint 9:** Address UAT feedback, fix bugs, stabilize solution + implement global monitoring dashboards

**Quality Gates:**

- 99.5% system availability target _([Success Metrics](Project-Proposal.md#success-metrics))_
- Successful cloud data streaming validation
- Operator training completion

### Phase 4: Global Factory Rollout (ongoing after phase 3)

**Focus:** Deploy to factories across the globe using automated pipelines

- **Deployment Infrastructure:** GitOps pipelines for multi-factory deployment
- **Factory Onboarding:** Standardized process for new factory integration
- **Regional Rollout:** Phased deployment based on rollout plan
- **Support Structure:** Support model (GEUS) + factory stakeholders
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Dashboards that support high-level `Observability`
- **Global Analytics:** Cloud-based universal monitoring and cross-factory performance analytics

**Rollout Strategy:** _Detailed in [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md#global-rollout-strategy-deferred-canary-releases)_

- UAT Environment Pipeline
- Factory Release Process with gradual activation

### Phase 5: Intelligence & Scale (Future improvements)

**Focus:** Add ML capabilities and production readiness

- **Sprint 10-11:** `ML Solution` foundation + **MLOps Observability** setup leveraging cloud data lake
- **Sprint 12+:** MLOps pipeline, global ML model training, testing, production rollout

**ML Integration:** _See [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md#7-solution-improvements-using-ml-solution)_

- Historic data provision for ML models
- Global data lake leveraging for cross-factory optimization

## Sprint Planning Integration

**Architecture-Driven Planning:** _Detailed methodology in [Ways of Working](Ways-of-Working.md#visual-planning-with-architecture-snapshots)_

Each sprint planning session:

1. **Current State Review:** Architecture diagram snapshot showing progress
2. **Target State Vision:** Post-sprint architecture goals
3. **Gap Analysis:** Components needing development
4. **Dependency Mapping:** Integration points and blockers
5. **Risk Visualization:** Critical paths and external dependencies

## Risk Management During Implementation

**Technical Risk Mitigation:** _Full risk analysis in [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md#key-risks)_

- **Sprint 1-2:** OPC-UA compatibility testing, containerization validation
- **Sprint 3-6:** Cloud integration resilience, data quality validation
- **Sprint 7-9:** Production impact assessment, rollback procedures
- **Phase 4:** Factory-specific deployment challenges, network connectivity

**Team Health Monitoring:** _Practices detailed in [Ways of Working](Ways-of-Working.md#team-health-and-morale)_

- Pair programming knowledge distribution
- Firefighter rotation for legacy support
- Regular team satisfaction tracking

## Success Metrics by Phase

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**

- Stable OPC-UA connection established
- Basic containerization working
- Test framework foundation in place

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**

- End-to-end data flow from CM to cloud data lake
- Automated configuration application working
- Local dashboards displaying real-time data

**Phase 3 Success Criteria:**

- UAT deployment successful

- Operator training completed

**Phase 4 Success Criteria:**

- Multi-factory deployment pipeline operational

- 50% reduction in manual configuration changes _(Target from [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md#operational-impact))_

## Implementation Dependencies

**External Integrations:**

- Recipe API team coordination
- Line Configuration team alignment
- ML specialist collaboration for Phase 5

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

- Factory Kubernetes cluster setup
- Cloud data lake provisioning
- Network connectivity validation

**Compliance Prerequisites:**

- GDPR compliance validation _(Details in [Project Proposal](Project-Proposal.md#gdpr-and-data-handling))_
- Privacy Impact Assessments
- Data sovereignty verification
